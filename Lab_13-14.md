# **Experiment - 13 & 14**

_Implement chown, chmod command with their options_

#

### **Approach**

Use `chown` to change file ownership and `chmod` to modify file permissions. Both commands can be used with various options for different use cases.

### **Syntax**

**`touch [filename]`**  
Creates an empty file with the specified name.

**`chown [user] [filename]`**  
Changes the ownership of a file to the specified user.

**`chmod [permissions] [filename]`**  
Modifies the file's permissions based on the specified values.

### **Example**

```
touch file1.txt

```

```
chown jolly file1.txt

```

```
ls -l file1.txt

```

```
touch file2.txt

```

```
chmod 755 file2.txt

```

```
ls -l file2.txt

```
